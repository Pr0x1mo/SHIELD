 Legal Rights and Protections Under the SCRA
      Servicemembers on "active duty" or "active service," or a spouse or dependent of such a
 servicemember may be entitled to certain legal protections and debt
 relief pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 USC
 3901-4043) (SCRA).

 Who May Be Entitled to Legal Protections Under the SCRA?
    *  Regular members of the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force Marine Corps
       and Coast Guard).
    *  Reserve and National Guard personnel who have been activated and are on Federal
       active duty
    *  National Guard personnel  under a call or order to active duty for more than 30
       consecutive days under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, for
       purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and
       supported by Federal funds
    *  Active service members of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service
       and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    *  Certain United States citizens serving with the armed forces of a nation with
       which the United States is allied in the prosecution of a war or military
       action.

 What Legal Protections Are Servicemembers Entitled To Under the SCRA?
    *  The SCRA states that a debt incurred by a servicemember, or servicemember and
       spouse jointly, prior to entering military service shall not bear interest at a
       rate above 6% during the period of military service and one year thereafter, in
       the case of an obligation or liability consisting of a mortgage, trust deed, or
       other security in the nature of a mortgage, or during the period of military
       service in the case of any other obligation or liability.
    *  The SCRA states that in a legal action to enforce a debt against real estate
       that is filed during, or within one year after the servicemember's military
       service, a court may stop the proceedings for a period of time, or adjust the
       debt.  In addition, the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of real estate shall not
       be valid if it occurs during or within one year after the servicemember's
       military service unless the creditor has obtained a valid court order approving
       the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of the real estate.
    *  The SCRA contains many other protections besides those applicable to home loans.

 How Does A Servicemember or Dependent Request Relief Under the SCRA?
    *  In order to request relief under the SCRA from loans with interest rates above
       6% a servicemember or spouse must provide a written request to the lender,
       together with a copy of the servicemember's military orders. The address for
       written requests is CIBC BANK USA, LOAN SERVICING, 6825 WEST 111TH STREET,
       WORTH, IL 60482.  For further assistance please call 1-877-448-6500.
    *  There is no requirement under the SCRA, however, for a servicemember to provide
       a written notice or a copy of a servicemember's military orders to the lender
       in connection with a foreclosure or other debt enforcement action against real
       estate. Under these circumstances, lenders should inquire about the military
       status of a person by searching the Department of Defense's Defense Manpower
       Data Center's website, contacting the servicemember, and examining their files
       for indicia of military service. Although there is no requirement for
       sevicemembers to alert the lender of their military status in these situations,
       it still is a good idea for the servicemember to do so.

 How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Obtain Information About the SCRA?
    *  Servicemembers and dependents with questions about the SCRA should contact
       their unit's Judge Advocate, or their installation's Legal Assistance Officer.
       A military legal assistance office locator for all branches of the Armed Forces
       is available at https://legalassistance.law.af.mil/
    *  "Military OneSource" is the U.S. Department of Defense's information resource.
       If you are listed as entitled to legal protections under the SCRA (see above),

 Legal Rights and Protections Under the SCRA
      Servicemembers on "active duty" or "active service," or a spouse or dependent of such a
 servicemember may be entitled to certain legal protections and debt
 relief pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 USC
 3901-4043) (SCRA).

 Who May Be Entitled to Legal Protections Under the SCRA?
    *  Regular members of the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force Marine Corps
       and Coast Guard).
    *  Reserve and National Guard personnel who have been activated and are on Federal
       active duty
    *  National Guard personnel  under a call or order to active duty for more than 30
       consecutive days under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, for
       purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and
       supported by Federal funds
    *  Active service members of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service
       and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    *  Certain United States citizens serving with the armed forces of a nation with
       which the United States is allied in the prosecution of a war or military
       action.

 What Legal Protections Are Servicemembers Entitled To Under the SCRA?
    *  The SCRA states that a debt incurred by a servicemember, or servicemember and
       spouse jointly, prior to entering military service shall not bear interest at a
       rate above 6% during the period of military service and one year thereafter, in
       the case of an obligation or liability consisting of a mortgage, trust deed, or
       other security in the nature of a mortgage, or during the period of military
       service in the case of any other obligation or liability.
    *  The SCRA states that in a legal action to enforce a debt against real estate
       that is filed during, or within one year after the servicemember's military
       service, a court may stop the proceedings for a period of time, or adjust the
       debt.  In addition, the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of real estate shall not
       be valid if it occurs during or within one year after the servicemember's
       military service unless the creditor has obtained a valid court order approving
       the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of the real estate.
    *  The SCRA contains many other protections besides those applicable to home loans.

 How Does A Servicemember or Dependent Request Relief Under the SCRA?
    *  In order to request relief under the SCRA from loans with interest rates above
       6% a servicemember or spouse must provide a written request to the lender,
       together with a copy of the servicemember's military orders. The address for
       written requests is CIBC BANK USA, LOAN SERVICING, 6825 WEST 111TH STREET,
       WORTH, IL 60482.  For further assistance please call 1-877-448-6500.
    *  There is no requirement under the SCRA, however, for a servicemember to provide
       a written notice or a copy of a servicemember's military orders to the lender
       in connection with a foreclosure or other debt enforcement action against real
       estate. Under these circumstances, lenders should inquire about the military
       status of a person by searching the Department of Defense's Defense Manpower
       Data Center's website, contacting the servicemember, and examining their files
       for indicia of military service. Although there is no requirement for
       sevicemembers to alert the lender of their military status in these situations,
       it still is a good idea for the servicemember to do so.

 How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Obtain Information About the SCRA?
    *  Servicemembers and dependents with questions about the SCRA should contact
       their unit's Judge Advocate, or their installation's Legal Assistance Officer.
       A military legal assistance office locator for all branches of the Armed Forces
       is available at https://legalassistance.law.af.mil/
    *  "Military OneSource" is the U.S. Department of Defense's information resource.
       If you are listed as entitled to legal protections under the SCRA (see above),
       please go to www.militaryonesource.mil/legal or call 1-800-342-9647 (toll free
       from the United States) to find out more information. Dialing instructions for
       areas outside the United States are provided on the website.

       written requests is CIBC BANK USA, LOAN SERVICING, 6825 WEST 111TH STREET,
       WORTH, IL 60482.  For further assistance please call 1-877-448-6500.
    *  There is no requirement under the SCRA, however, for a servicemember to provide
       a written notice or a copy of a servicemember's military orders to the lender
       in connection with a foreclosure or other debt enforcement action against real
       estate. Under these circumstances, lenders should inquire about the military
       status of a person by searching the Department of Defense's Defense Manpower
       Data Center's website, contacting the servicemember, and examining their files
       for indicia of military service. Although there is no requirement for
       sevicemembers to alert the lender of their military status in these situations,
       it still is a good idea for the servicemember to do so.

 How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Obtain Information About the SCRA?
    *  Servicemembers and dependents with questions about the SCRA should contact
       their unit's Judge Advocate, or their installation's Legal Assistance Officer.
       A military legal assistance office locator for all branches of the Armed Forces
       is available at https://legalassistance.law.af.mil/
    *  "Military OneSource" is the U.S. Department of Defense's information resource.
       If you are listed as entitled to legal protections under the SCRA (see above),
       please go to www.militaryonesource.mil/legal or call 1-800-342-9647 (toll free
       from the United States) to find out more information. Dialing instructions for
       areas outside the United States are provided on the website.
